# Billing Setup Plan for Bill-O Firebase Project

## Current Status
- **Project ID**: billo-692b3
- **Issue**: 403 Forbidden errors due to billing not being set up
- **Impact**: Firestore and other Firebase services are not accessible

## Required Actions

### 1. Set Up Billing Account
- [ ] Log in to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
- [ ] Select the "billo-692b3" project
- [ ] Go to "Billing" in the left sidebar
- [ ] Click "Link a billing account"
- [ ] Follow prompts to set up or select an existing billing account
- [ ] Ensure billing is enabled for all necessary services

### 2. Enable Required APIs
After billing is set up, enable these APIs if not already enabled:
- [ ] Cloud Firestore API
- [ ] Firebase Management API
- [ ] Identity Toolkit API

### 3. Verify Project Quotas
- [ ] Check usage quotas in Google Cloud Console
- [ ] Monitor usage to prevent unexpected charges
- [ ] Set up budget alerts if desired

### 4. Test After Setup
- [ ] Try accessing the app again: https://billo-692b3.web.app
- [ ] Verify Firestore read/write operations work
- [ ] Check console for any remaining errors

## Cost Considerations
- Review Firebase's [pricing page](https://firebase.google.com/pricing) for current rates
- Set budget alerts in Google Cloud Console
- Monitor usage in the Firebase Console under "Usage and billing"

## Notes
- Billing is required for Firestore in production mode
- Free tier has generous limits for development
- Consider upgrading to Blaze (pay-as-you-go) plan for production
