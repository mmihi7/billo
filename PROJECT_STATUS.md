# Bill-O Project Status

## Project Overview
A restaurant management system with customer ordering and table management capabilities.

## Current Challenges

### 1. Firebase Billing Setup (Blocking)
- **Status**: Pending
- **Impact**: 403 Forbidden errors, Firestore inaccessible
- **Action Required**: Set up billing account in Google Cloud Console
- **Priority**: Critical

### 2. QR Code Scanning
- **Status**: Partially Fixed
- **Issue**: Scanner now handles both URL and JSON formats
- **Remaining**: Need to test with actual QR codes after billing is set up

### 3. Menu Management
- **Status**: In Progress
- **Completed**:
  - Consolidated menu item forms
  - Added duplicate item functionality
- **Remaining**:
  - Remove duplicate menu lists in RestaurantDashboard
  - Test menu item CRUD operations

## Task List

### High Priority
- [ ] Set up Firebase billing account
- [ ] Test Firestore connectivity after billing setup
- [ ] Verify QR code scanning works in production
- [ ] Clean up duplicate menu lists in RestaurantDashboard

### Medium Priority
- [ ] Implement proper error handling for Firestore operations
- [ ] Add loading states for async operations
- [ ] Test on multiple devices/browsers

### Low Priority
- [ ] Add input validation for all forms
- [ ] Implement proper user feedback for actions
- [ ] Add unit tests for critical components

## Next Steps

2. Test core functionality with actual data
3. Address any remaining UI/UX issues
4. Prepare for initial testing phase

## Notes
- Billing setup is currently the main blocker
- Test user flows after billing is enabled
- Monitor Firestore usage to stay within free tier limits
